# This is a Repository for all of the Course work included in COMPSCI 220 Intermediate JAVA

## This class was a fully remote six week minamal instruction course

### All of this work was completed by myself with little to no background in JAVA

### Throughout this course, we worked and refined one project. This project was a console based organization system of Ice Skaters data.
